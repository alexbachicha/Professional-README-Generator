## Installation

To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
First, run npm install in order to install the dependencies necessary as specified in the package.json. Then, install inquirer and axios by running npm install inquirer and npm install axios. The application can then be invoked by running node index.js
```

## Usage

When you run node index.js, the application uses the inquirer package to prompt the user in the command-line with a series of questions about their GitHub project. The application then uses axios to fetch the GitHub profile from the GitHub API and generates markdown and a table of contents for the README file. Finally, fs.writeFile is used to generate the user's README.md file.
